Done:
1. create function that calls synthesiser
2. exhaustive search function that call synthesis function

2.a function that either parses info from string or fetches correct info from previous synthesis.

 2.b save data
 -- read data from 'FILENAME'.CSV
 -- append csv row as string to results.csv
 -- get latency and area from string
 -- show data in DARC Lab program


 read in file repository in cmdline

- add TCLAP functions 


- TCLAP choose results file_name else iterate on results
- TCLAP to choose csv_class_name

MAJOR FIX:
- fix scaling issue of cost function latency at 1 is overpowered by

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- add label tag to csv file
- if results file already exists just append to it and dont readd header

Todo:

- failed count vs successful synthesis

- validate Heuristic --create prgoram to randomly simulate exploration and  that heuristic does explore for multiple weights correctly

- Powerpoint




BONUS
1. implement signal handlers
   - hard kill
   - exit after run finishes
